# Grocery Planner

A family meal planning and grocery list generation tool for local network deployment.

## Overview

Streamlines the process of planning meals and generating grocery lists by:
- Storing recipes with ingredients and amounts
- Planning meals for 1-2 weeks on specific dates
- Automatically generating shopping lists with ingredient counts
- Managing staple items and store ordering preferences

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router) with TypeScript (strict mode)
- **UI:** Mantine component library
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (email/password)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend)
- **Multi-tenancy:** Shopping groups with owner/member roles

## Architecture Decisions

- **Data Operations:** Server actions (no API routes)
- **State Management:** React state with optimistic updates
- **Forms:** Mantine form system
- **Database:** Supabase cloud PostgreSQL
- **Schema Management:** Supabase migrations
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth middleware
- **Security:** Row Level Security (RLS) for data isolation

## Data Model

### Core Entities
- **Item:** Grocery items with optional staple status and store ordering
- **Recipe:** Named collections of ingredients with amounts
- **PlanningSession:** 14-day meal planning periods with start date
- **MealAssignment:** Links specific recipes to specific dates
- **StapleSelection:** Per-session staple item selections (pending/included/excluded)
- **AdHocItem:** User-added items not from recipes or staples
- **ItemExclusion:** Items to exclude from shopping list (we have enough at home)

## Application Structure

### Pages
- `/` - Home (meal planning + live shopping list)
- `/recipes` - Recipe management (CRUD)
- `/recipes/new` - Add new recipe
- `/recipes/[id]` - Edit existing recipe
- `/store-order` - Drag-and-drop item ordering for shopping route
- `/staples` - Master staples list management

### Key Features
- **Live Shopping List:** Updates automatically as meals are planned
- **Item Autocomplete:** Smart ingredient entry with create-new capability
- **Flexible Planning:** 14 consecutive days starting from chosen date
- **Amount Concatenation:** "flour: 1 cup, 2 tbsp (+ 1 other recipe)"
- **Store Ordering:** Custom item sequence matching shopping route
- **Responsive Design:** Works on phones, tablets, and desktop

## Installation & Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account (free tier)

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
# Create .env.local with:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://yourproject.supabase.co
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Vercel Deployment
```bash
# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# Vercel auto-deploys from GitHub
# Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
# - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

### Database Setup
See `supabase.sql` in project root for complete schema. Run in Supabase SQL Editor to:
- Create all tables with proper relationships
- Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Configure automatic group creation on user signup

## Database Schema

See `supabase.sql` for the complete data model. Key relationships:
- **Multi-tenancy:** All data scoped to `shopping_groups` with RLS enforcement
- **Recipes:** Recipe → RecipeItem → Item (many-to-many through junction table)
- **Meal Planning:** PlanningSession → Meals → MealRecipes/MealItems (flexible structure)
- **Shopping Lists:** Aggregates from recipes, staples, adhoc items, and exclusions
- **Invitations:** Pending invitations system with owner/member roles
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth with automatic group creation on signup

## Usage Workflow

1. **Add Recipes:** Enter recipe names and ingredients with optional amounts
2. **Plan Meals:** Select start date, assign recipes to specific days (14-day span)
3. **Review Shopping List:** Auto-generated list shows ingredient counts and amounts
4. **Manage Staples:** Configure standard items to check each shopping trip
5. **Order Items:** Arrange items to match your typical store shopping route
6. **Exclude Items:** Skip items you already have at home

## Design Philosophy

- **Functionality over aesthetics:** Focus on workflow efficiency
- **Cloud-based multi-tenancy:** Secure data isolation between families
- **Optimistic UI updates:** Instant feedback for all user actions
- **Progressive enhancement:** Build complexity incrementally
- **Mobile-first:** Optimized for in-store shopping on phones
- **Collaborative:** Multiple family members can share and manage together
