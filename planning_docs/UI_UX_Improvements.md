# UI/UX Improvements Checklist

## 🎯 **High-Impact Improvements**

### **1. Loading States & Feedback**
- [ ] Add loading spinners for async operations (session creation, recipe saving, item additions)
- [ ] Toast notifications for actions (recipe saved, item added, session created)
- [ ] Optimistic updates - update UI immediately, then sync with server
- [ ] Add loading state to "New Session" button (mentioned in TODO at MealPlanner.tsx:77)

### **2. Empty States & Onboarding**
- [ ] Enhanced empty states with illustrations and helpful CTAs:
  - [ ] Recipes page: Add cooking-themed icon and "Create your first recipe" guidance
  - [ ] Shopping list: Show example items when no meals planned
  - [ ] Meal planning: Step-by-step guidance for first-time users
- [ ] Progressive disclosure - hide advanced features until user has basic data

### **3. Visual Hierarchy & Spacing**
- [ ] Card elevation/shadows - Mantine supports this but you're using flat cards
- [ ] Section dividers with subtle lines or spacing between related groups
